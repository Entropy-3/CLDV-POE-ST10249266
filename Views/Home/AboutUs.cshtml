        general information

    <p style ="font-weight:bold;">
        My name is James Khumalo. I am a young artisan who creates art through <br />
        multiple different mediums such as clay and wood, i like to think of <br />
        myself as a driven and creative individual who strives to always do his best.

        Our Goal
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align:right; font-weight:bold">
        My intention with this e-commerce website is to create a safe place for creative,<br/> innovative artists to become blossoming entrpreneurs and 
        sell<br/> their hard work to like minded individuals who enjoy art.

    <h3>
        how we plan to do this
    </h3>
    <p>
        This website will serve as a marketplace that aspiring artists can list their work for people to see and buy.<br />
        the website will work as a middleman removing the risk for both the artist and the buyer. Artisists will be<br />
        entitled to 95% of the sale as the website will take 5% for maintenance and running costs.<br />
        Both artist and buyer can rest assured that their best interests will be taken into account<br />
        and they will be protected when they make a purchase.
